# Automated Email Server

# Using YAML's "yes" and "no" keywords for booleans would be preferred because
# it sounds more natural, however, the JS-YAML module for Node.js does not
# support these keywords unless they are cast as boolean, which looks clumsy.
# Therefore we are using JS-YAML's keywords of "true" (yes) and "false" (no).
